# Snake Game

Enjoy the classic Snake game with both a manual player-controlled version and an AI-driven version. Play as the snake and eat as much food as you can while avoiding collisions. Challenge yourself and see if you can beat the AI's high score!

## Manual Snake Game (manual.py)

Control the snake with the arrow keys and guide it to consume the food. Be careful not to collide with the walls or yourself. Compete against your friends to achieve the highest score!

To play the manual version, run the following command:

```bash
python snake_game_manual.py
```

AI Snake Game (snake_game_ai.py)
Watch the AI navigate the snake to chase the food and accumulate points. The AI utilizes a reinforcement learning algorithm to make decisions, aiming to achieve the highest score and outperform human players.

To watch the AI play the game, run the following command:
```bash
python snake_game_ai.py
```

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pygame numpy
```

## Game Controls (Manual Version)

Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake: Up, Down, Left, Right.


## AI Snake Strategy

The AI snake uses a reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the best strategies for maximizing its score. Watch as it evolves its tactics and competes with the manual player!
